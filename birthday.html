        <p><strong>June 8th, 2019 6:00PM, Be More Pacific</strong></p>
        
        <p>If I sent you this link*, you're invited to my birthday dinner! This year, I'm hosting my birthday dinner at <a href="http://www.bemorepacifickitchenandbar.com/">Be More Pacific</a>. It's a Filipino restaurant up on Anderson Lane that I'd like to share with you. In the Philippines, the birthday boy treats everyone to dinner, so I am following the custom! The food at BMP is all served family style, so we'll order a bit of everything everyone's interested in.</p>

        <p>Please <strong>RSVP by May 31st</strong> via text, FB messenger, email, carrier pigeon, etc... so I can make a reservation!</p>

        <p>(* if I didn't send you this link and you're reading this, you're clever, but you're not invited. Sorry!)</p>
