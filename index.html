        <h3>Fix the delivery, accountability, and incident response of your software engineering team</h3>

        <p>
          You've worked hard to build your startup. You have the clients you always hoped to reach. And your platform has to be reliable.
        </p>
        <p>
          But your software engineering team isn't delivering at the level you hope they would. You're unsure of the state of new features. Outages are increasing and becoming more severe even though you use stable, "boring" technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          You miss the early days when you could just edit the database and make your clients happy. When people ask if you're doing Agile, you say "yes," but you know that's not entirely true. Something isn't working. Shouldn't it be more flexible than this?
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine if the status of projects was easy to find. The team is consistently delivering features when they say they will. The endless stand-ups, checkins, and 1:1 meetings are off your calendar. And the platform is noticeably faster, with room for the sustaining growth you need.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can help make this a reality.
